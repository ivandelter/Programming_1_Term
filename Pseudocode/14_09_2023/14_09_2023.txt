3) Ask for 2 numbers and if they aren't equal tell which one is the biggest one.

Algorithm EXERCISE_3
	DATA
		x1, x2 integer numeric var
	START
		READ x1
		READ x2
		if(x1 != x2) do
			if(x1 > x2) do
				print "x1 is bigger"
			else
				print "x2 is bigger"
			end if
		end if
END algorithm

4) Ask for a number and check if it is even. If it is even, print the number; otherwise sum 1 to the number and print it

Algorithm EXERCISE_4
	DATA 
		x integer numeric var
	START
		READ x
		if(x % 2 == 0)
			print a
		else
			a = a + 1
			print a
		end if
END algorithm

5) Ask for a number, user age, and check in which range it is. If the user inputs a number that is not in the range 10-50, print an error message
Algorithm EXERCISE_5
	DATA
		age numeric var
	START
		READ age
		switch(age)
			if(age >= 10 && age <= 50)
				if(age < 20)
					print 10
				else if(age < 20)
					print 20
				else if(age < 30)
					print 30
				else if(age < 40)
					print 40
				else
					print 50
END Algorithm

6) Ask for a number and write the corresponding name of the month
Algorithm EXERCISE_5
	DATA
		month numeric var
	START
		READ month
		switch(month)
			case 1:
				print "January"
				break
			case 2:
				print "February"
				break
			case 3:
				print "March"
				break
			case 4:
				print "April"
				break
			case 5:
				print "May"
				break
			case 6:
				print "June"
				break
			case 7:
				print "July"
				break
			case 8:
				print "August"
				break
			case 9:
				print "September"
				break
			case 10:
				print "October"
				break
			case 11:
				print "November"
				break
			case 12:
				print "December"
				break
			default:
				print "You must write a number between 1 and 12"
				break
END algorithm

[ ITERATIONS ]
1) Count from 1 to 100
Algorithm ITERATION_1
	DATA 
		x numeric var
	START
		READ x
		x = 1
		for x <= 100 step 1 repeat
			Write x
END Algorithm
